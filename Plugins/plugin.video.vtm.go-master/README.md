# VTM GO Kodi add-on

**This add-on is currently under development and isn't ready for use yet. The [Release 1.0](https://github.com/michaelarnauts/plugin.video.vtm.go/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22Release+1.0%22) milestone indicates what issues I think are blocking the general use of this add-on.**

*plugin.video.vtm.go* is a Kodi add-on for watching live video streams and video-on-demand content available on the VTM GO platform. 

> Note: You will need to create an account and a profile first on the [VTM GO website](https://vtm.be/vtmgo). This add-on will also play the advertisements that are added to the streams by VTM GO.
